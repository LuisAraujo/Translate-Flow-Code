TCF is a tool to create flow-chart, run it and convert it to programming language as Javascript, Java, Python and other.


### For Education

This project is a tool education for teach programming for novices. Transition between flow and code is hard. Students do not experienced interation or debug writing flow with pen and pepper. So I am creating this tool for to minimize the gap between flow and code. 

Features (In Development):

- The teacher can create list of problemas for our students;
- Students can solve problemas or create a free flow;
- Students save all flow in platforma;
- Teacher can view all flow of your studantes;
- Teacher can send a message for creator of flow;
- Teacher can create a Unit Tests for problems;
- Studantes get imediaty feedback with Unit Tests;
- Students can view your flow in some programming languages;
- Students can run your flow;
- Students can save your flow as image;



### How Work

First this tool have a engine for create flow-chart, using canvas for visualization. This flow-chart is converted to text format and after converted for javascript. This gerated javascript is used for run the code in browser. This tool use the text format of flow-chart for gerating codes in other languages.
